	abstract = {The proliferation of geospatial applications has tremendously increased the variety, velocity, and volume of spatial data that data stores have to manage. Traditional relational databases reveal limitations in handling such big geospatial data, mainly due to their rigid schema requirements and limited scalability. Numerous NoSQL databases have emerged and actively serve as alternative data stores for big spatial data. This study presents a framework, called GeoYCSB, developed for benchmarking NoSQL databases with geospatial workloads. To develop GeoYCSB, we extend YCSB, a de facto benchmark framework for NoSQL systems, by integrating into its design architecture the new components necessary to support geospatial workloads. GeoYCSB supports both microbenchmarks and macrobenchmarks and facilitates the use of real datasets in both. It is extensible to evaluate any NoSQL database, provided they support spatial queries, using geospatial workloads performed on datasets of any geometric complexity. We use GeoYCSB to benchmark two leading document stores, MongoDB and Couchbase, and present the experimental results and analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the extensibility of GeoYCSB by including a new dataset consisting of complex geometries and using it to benchmark a system with a wide variety of geospatial queries: Apache Accumulo, a wide-column store, with the GeoMesa framework applied on top.},

	abstract = {Tracking application is widely used to help outdoor activities. One of them is used to help tourists who do tourist destinations in group activities. Tourist tracking application requires data on the position of tourists on earth. This coordinate data can be obtained using latitude and longitude data from GPS (Global Positioning System). Coordinate latitude and longitude position of tourists from time to time are stored in a database. Database Selection for media storage will determines the level of speed and ease in accessing data. There are some differences in designing the structure of the MySql and Firebase databases. Relational Database begins with identification of entities involved in the system. One entity with another entity is related and has a cardinality level of the relationship. Relational database implementation in the form of tables in normal forms that are interconnected. Data will be stored in columns and rows. Normalization of tables causes high query computation when calling data that involves many tables. Firebase, which is one of the NoSql databases, in building data structures is stored in JSON objects. JSON tree structures usually consider the display of information that will be presented to users. So that the generated JSON tree has high efficiency and speed in processing data. In this study a comparison between the design of the relational database structure, namely MySql and NoSql Firebase database structure was developed. Firebase is more power full for the development of applications which update data in realtime and and handle a lot of coordinate data such as tourist tracking applications. Applications that do not have complex data relations such as tourist tracking applications are more suitable to use firebase than using MySQL.},

While techniques for computing justifications for entailments in consistent ontologies are theoretically and practically well-understood, little is known about the practicalities of computing justifications for inconsistent ontologies. This is despite the fact that justifications are important for repairing inconsistent ontologies, and can be used as a basis for paraconsistent reasoning. This paper presents algorithms, optimisations, and experiments in this area. Surprisingly, it turns out that justifications for inconsistent ontologies are more “difficult” to compute and are often more “numerous” than justifications for entailments in consistent ontologies: whereas it is always possible to compute some justifications, it is often not possible to compute all justifications for real world inconsistent ontologies.},

HermiT is based on the hypertableau calculus, and it supports a wide range of standard and novel optimisations that improve the performance of reasoning on real-world ontologies. Apart from the standard OWL 2 reasoning task of entailment checking, HermiT supports several specialised reasoning services such as class and property classification, as well as a range of features outside the OWL 2 standard such as DL-safe rules, SPARQL queries, and description graphs. We discuss the system’s architecture, and we present an overview of the techniques used to support the mentioned reasoning tasks. We further compare the performance of reasoning in HermiT with that of FaCT++ and Pellet—two other popular and widely used OWL 2 reasoners.},

One of the central concepts in this area is the Semantic Web, with the vision of providing a well-defined meaning to information and services on the Web through a set of standards. Particularly, linked data and ontologies have been quite essential for data sharing, discovery, integration, and reuse. In this paper, we provide a systematic literature review on knowledge graph creation from structured and semi-structured data sources using Semantic Web technologies. The review takes into account four prominent publication venues, namely, Extended Semantic Web Conference, International Semantic Web Conference, Journal of Web Semantics, and Semantic Web Journal. The review highlights the tools, methods, types of data sources, ontologies, and publication methods, together with the challenges, limitations, and lessons learned in the knowledge graph creation processes.},

	abstract = {Digital twin, a concept introduced in 2002, is becoming increasingly relevant to systems engineering and, more specifically, to model-based system engineering (MBSE). A digital twin, like a virtual prototype, is a dynamic digital representation of a physical system. However, unlike a virtual prototype, a digital twin is a virtual instance of a physical system (twin) that is continually updated with the latter\&rsquo;s performance, maintenance, and health status data throughout the physical system\&rsquo;s life cycle. This paper presents an overall vision and rationale for incorporating digital twin technology into MBSE. The paper discusses the benefits of integrating digital twins with system simulation and Internet of Things (IoT) in support of MBSE and provides specific examples of the use and benefits of digital twin technology in different industries. It concludes with a recommendation to make digital twin technology an integral part of MBSE methodology and experimentation testbeds.},

	abstract = {With more substantial funding from research organizations and industry, numerous large-scale applications, and recently developed technologies, the Semantic Web is quickly emerging as a well-recognized and important area of computer science. While Semantic Web technologies are still rapidly evolving, Foundations of Semantic Web Technologies focuses on the established foundations in this area that have become relatively stable over time. It thoroughly covers basic introductions and intuitions, technical details, and formal foundations.The book concentrates on Semantic Web technologies standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium: RDF and SPARQL enable data exchange and querying, RDFS and OWL provide expressive ontology modeling, and RIF supports rule-based modeling. The text also describes methods for specifying, querying, and reasoning with ontological information. In addition, it explores topics that are clearly beyond foundations, such as tools, applications, and engineering aspects.Written by highly respected researchers with a deep understanding of the material, this text centers on the formal specifications of the subject and supplies many pointers that are useful for employing Semantic Web technologies in practice.Updates, errata, slides for teaching, and links to further resources are available at http://semantic-web-book.org/},

	abstract = {While considered a relatively emergent area of research (Bloch and Sacks in Autom Constr 91:256–272, 2018), Semantic Enrichment (SE) and Semantic Web services are among the prominent topics and trends in BIM research (BIM handbook a guide to building information modeling for owners, designers, engineers, contractors, and facility managers, John Wiley \& Sons Inc, New Jersey). SE computational approaches provide valuable means to overcome current BIM limitations such as interoperability, topology relationships, extensions to standard schemas, among many others. Therefore, the study herein consists of a semi-systematic literature review on BIM-based SE systems and applications developed during the last decade. The article describes the computational methods and approaches identified, a classification of the screened papers according to their primary BIM Use (https://bim.psu.edu/uses/), as well as reported limitations and recommendations for future developments. From the selected articles, main developments in SE techniques encompass multidisciplinary approaches comprising the use of Semantic Web technologies; inference rules, and rule processing engines; artificial intelligence methods; ontology mapping and semantic similarity; application of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) libraries; and custom plugins. Considering BIM Uses, research was mostly focused on "Capture Existing Conditions" and "Validate Code Compliance". Other identified BIM Uses " verified three or fewer occurrences. Reported limitations state that more user-friendly interfaces are required to handle SPARQL queries (Lee et al. in Autom Constr 68:102–113, 2016). Moreover, the ontologies development process is deemed as time-consuming (Zhong et al. in Build Environ 141:127–142, 2018), and constraints were identified when trying to share semantic data between BIM and Geographic Information System (GIS) platforms (Zhong et al. in Build Environ 141:127–142, 2018). Future research may be expected in transitions to a more extended BIM paradigm, such as the formalization of Digital Twinning processes; discussions concerning a standard format for SPARQL query results (Karan and Irizarry in Autom Constr 53:1–12, 2015); as well as enhanced support through the transition to Linked Data and ontology-based systems.},

	abstract = {Increasing reliance on automation and robotization presents great opportunities to improve the management of construction sites as well as existing buildings. Crucial in the use of robots in a built environment is their capacity to locate themselves and navigate as autonomously as possible. Robots often rely on planar and 3D laser scanners for that purpose, and building information models (BIM) are seldom used, for a number of reasons, namely their unreliability, unavailability, and mismatch with localization algorithms used in robots. However, while BIM models are becoming increasingly reliable and more commonly available in more standard data formats (JSON, XML, RDF), they become more promising and reliable resources for localization and indoor navigation, in particular in the more static types of existing infrastructure (existing buildings). In this article, we specifically investigate to what extent and how such building data can be used for such robot navigation. Data flows are built from BIM model to local repository and further to the robot, making use of graph data models (RDF) and JSON data formats. The local repository can hereby be considered to be a digital twin of the real-world building. Navigation on the basis of a BIM model is tested in a real world environment (university building) using a standard robot navigation technology stack. We conclude that it is possible to rely on BIM data and we outline different data flows from BIM model to digital twin and to robot. Future work can focus on (1) making building data models more reliable and standard (modelling guidelines and robot world model), (2) improving the ways in which building features in the digital building model can be recognized in 3D point clouds observed by the robots, and (3) investigating possibilities to update the BIM model based on robot feedback.},
